# Socialcap Project

A community based credentials protocol on MINA, focused in solving the challenge of verifying the authenticity of credentials in the digital world.

#### Why

> Communities are the heart and soul of Web3, and ***credentials are the new foundation for building trust and reputation within them***. 

At this current moment in time, very few people in the Open Web communities will argue against this. But  credentials may assume various types and forms. 

In broader terms, as posted in the [Wikipedia credentials definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential): "A credential is a piece of any document that details a qualification, competence, or authority which has been issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials include academic diplomas, academic degrees, certifications, security clearances, identification documents, badges, passwords, user names, keys, powers of attorney, and so on ...". 

Socialcap aims to cover this broader definition by supporting many of the mentioned use cases. 

But this also leads to additional questions: Who is the "issuer" of the credential? Can we trust them? Can we prove in some way that the credential has been correctly issued? That it has not been "faked" or "tampered" with? Is it still valid?

In [Socialcap](https://socialcap.app), we tackle these issues in an innovative way: 

- We empower communities and their members to **issue credentials through a mechanism of 'social consensus'**, achieved via various forms of 'private voting'. 

- Our approach is fortified by [MINA Protocol's](https://minaprotocol.com/) unique Zero-Knowledge (ZK) privacy and proving capabilities.

**Socialcap goes beyond traditional credentialing systems, offering community based decentralized voting and issuance, and a privacy-focused solution that aligns with the principles of the Open Web communities. By combining social consensus and MINA's ZK unique capabilities, we have established a robust and reliable credentialing system for the future of online communities.**
